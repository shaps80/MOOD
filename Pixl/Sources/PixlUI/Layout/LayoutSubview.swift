///
/// Use a proxy to get information about the associated subview, like its
/// dimensions, layout priority, or custom layout values. You also use the
/// proxy to tell its corresponding subview where to appear by calling the
/// proxy's ``LayoutSubview/place(at:anchor:proposal:)`` method.
/// Do this once for each subview from your implementation of the layout's
/// ``Layout/placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`` method.
